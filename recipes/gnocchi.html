    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      You can begin by bringing a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.
      Then you may cook gnocchi in the boiling water until they float to the
      top, about 3 minutes. Drain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread 1/2 of the pasta
      sauce on the bottom of a 5-inch round casserole dish. Layer with gnocchi
      and spread the remaining pasta sauce on top. Sprinkle with mozzarella
      cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and bubbling,
      about 25 minutes. Finally, <b>enjoy!</b>
